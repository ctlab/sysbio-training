* A is very often the case
* B is almost never the case

---
## Why we measure RNA abundance

* While proteins are the key players in biological processes, RNA abundance is a good enough approximation for protein abundance


* Measuring RNA abundance is **much easier**


* Given several conditions and a gene: for <strong class='red'>the same gene</strong> fold change in RNA abundance will inform us about fold change in protein level
---
## Structure of mRNA

* We are mostly interested in mRNA (messenger RNA), because it is protein coding RNA
* Estimated 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> mRNA molecules per animal cell with high dynamic range for genes: from several copies to 10<sup>4</sup>

## Types of RNA

* rRNA - ribosomal RNA: 80% of total cell RNA
* tRNA - transfer RNA: 15% of the cell RNA
* mRNA - messenger RNA for protein-coding genes
* Others RNAs: miRNA, lncRNA

## Why we measure RNA abundance

What can be a sample? RNA isolated from pretty much anywhere

* Blood draw
* Tissue / organ
* Specific isolated cell type

---

## Gene expression studies


* Usually you have the phenotype, but you don't know why it happens
* You take samples from several conditions related to your phenotype
* You try to figure out what is different in your phenotype from the control (or other condition)

"Most people infected with M. tuberculosis remain asymptomatic, termed latent TB, with a 10% lifetime risk of developing active TB disease. Current tests, however, cannot identify which individuals will develop disease."

---

## Berry et al, 2010


* Here we identify a whole-blood 393 transcript signature for active TB in intermediate and high-burden settings, correlating with radiological extent of disease and reverting to that of healthy controls after treatment
* A subset of patients with latent TB had signatures similar to those in patients with active TB
* We also identify a specific 86-transcript signature that discriminates active TB from other inflammatory and infectious diseases

## How do we know what's diffent

Main word behind comparative gene expression studies is **differential expression** (DE). 

* Given two conditions *A* and *B* 
* We try to find genes for which we can statistically confirm that their average expression level in these two conditions is different

Briefly speaking, differential expression tests are statistical frameworks to identify genes of possible interest.

We say that gene is differentially expressed, when they have different average expression levels (between conditions).


---
## What else


* Previous example was about gene expression on a **gene level**
* We can go to **transcript level** and detect different isoforms

# Alternative splicing

---

## Terminology


* Alternative splicing, alternative transcription start- and termination sites
* All of the above we wall alternative splicing
* All of the above events expend RNA repertoire of most human genes

---

## Isoform switch


* Isoform switch is one of alternative splicing scenarios
* Under certain condition, gene is spliced differently

# Single-cell technologies

---

## Single-cell RNA-seq

* These days we can measure RNA abundance within single cells
* Better resolution: more samples (cells), better understanding where changes are coming from
* Worse resolution: we have much less RNA within a single cell than within a sample. We can capture even less. We can sequence even less
